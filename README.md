Figure 2. Distribution of House Types 

- Figure 2 shows the distribution of house types in Sydney. Most of types seem to be ‘House’ (85%), followed by townhouse (7%), duplex/semi-detached (3%) and villa (2%). However, considering that this analysis also includes the past years from 2000, there could be some changes in Sydney house types. 
Furthermore, Figure 3 shows distributions of numeric columns, including postcode, selling price, number of bed and bath, car space, year and month. Postcodes in Sydney are a range between 2000 and 3000. Also, the graph of years shows that most of house sales mainly happened between 2010 and 2020. When looking into the graph of months, the period of house sale usually happens in March and November.

Figure 4. Distribution of Selling Price of House Types by Years and Months

- Those two graphs show the distribution of selling price of each house type by years and months. Accordingly, house was only expensive in 2000 and kept similar selling price rate throughout years. Townhouse was especially very expensive in 2011 and kept similar selling price rate in other years. House type is generally the most expensive house type, but the price of terrace is continuously increasing over the years. 
When looking into months of selling price, many of houses were especially expensive in May and kept the similar rate overall. Townhouse is particularly expensive in October. 
Those visualizations clearly show that majority of house sales happen in March and November. Also, it would be good to avoid buying house in May and October. While house type is still primary house type in Sydney but there is a continuous increase in trends of townhouse and villa.
